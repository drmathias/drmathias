I'm currently working Monday to Friday as a software developer, building financial services products. Occasionally I write on [Develop Momentum](https://github.com/drmathias/developmomentum), to share knowledge that I've learned and promote technologies that I'm interested in. In my free time I like to go for walks and work out. Aside from the internet, I love dogs and plants. If you want to reach out, send me an email.
